This plugin provides a normal mode command 'gG', which moves to the first
effective line of the current file.
In this script, "effective line" means a line whose first character is
not a comment nor a preprocessor nor empty.

If you want to map the command to another keys than 'gG', add a line like below
in your vimrc.
  nmap YOURKEY <Plug>GotoFirstEffectiveLine
